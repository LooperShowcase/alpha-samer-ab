        Not only that,but Loop also acts as a youth tech movement that
        encourages children to forge friendships with people their age and
        shared interests in this community. <br />
        That feeling of belonging is vital for individuals going through a
        sensitive and eventful part of their lives. Learning about teamwork is a
        great asset to them, personally and, in the future, professionally.

        The straight-forward definition of Loop is a Hi-Tech academy. <br />
        Its purpose is to expose the next generations (called Loopers) to the
        world of computer science and technology and offer them a personalized
        fun-based educational method according to each student's preferences and
        ambitions in a well-structured and modular customized approach. <br />
        Also, since it is a long-term program, Loop is built to guide the
        Loopers through the years. <br />
        The mentorship aspect of it promotes the idea of a lifelong and ongoing
        system in which participants later may become mentors and contribute to
        the community and even become Loop partners, thereby completing the loop
        of knowledge.
